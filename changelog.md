# SecureABC Paper Change Log

Here we detail changes to the [SecureABC paper](SecureABC.pdf) which is mirrored here from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11833).

* 29 August 2020
 * We have improved our implementation of the system and correspondingly benchmarked its performance in the “implementation and performance” section of our paper. Our implementation now includes an Android application that is able to scan a SecureABC QR code, verify its cryptographic signature and then display the user attributes. Our implementation reveals some of the limitations of QR codes and helps to roadmap the key areas for optimisation of our approach in the future.
 * Following constructive debate about the exclusionary nature of antibody certificates we have rewritten our third general principle to now advocate for proportional and responsible use rather than "no restrictions...".
 * Our security evaluation has been tightened to focus only on the aspects that are within the technical scope of the work. 
 * We have made a number of additional minor improvements throughout the paper.

* 05 June 2020
  * Added new differentially private antibody certificate use case to appendices (in Section 9). This is an extension of the ideas in use case 2 which were developed in collaboration with James Bell.
  * Incorporated early feedback including greater specificity for use case 3, mitigating possible economic discrimination on the basis of requiring a user photograph, clarifying the use of GAN as a source of image only and the purpose of encryption in the app-based authentication protocol.
  * Improved literature review with updated references and greater clarity.
  * Fixes to spelling and grammar.


* 25 May 2020
  * Initial working paper online.
